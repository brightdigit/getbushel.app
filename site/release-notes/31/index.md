- Keeps track of open images, libraries, and machines
- Dropdown now shows previously used restore images
- Improved interface and flow for creating virutal machines

# Known Issues

- Certain restore images may not work due to sandboxing limitation. If building the machine does nothing, select a different restore image or re-open the restore library to grant sandboxing access to the image.
