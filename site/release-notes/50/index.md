Big improvements to the Session Window this release:

- #73	Pausing The Machine doesn't seem pausing it, instead just collecting all user interaction then hitting them once resume
- #169	The guest doesn't capture CMD+TAB to select another running app in the guest itself.
- #138	An overlay over machine window is required to indicate visually the machine is paused
- #165	Make Window Same Ratio as Display Resolution
- #117	Ability to add notes to snapshots
- #123	no snapshot button on window
- #63	Weird behavior for slider, and unstable number inputs of New Machine Window

### Known Issues
