### First TestFlight Build is here!

Thank you so much for your interest in Bushel. These first build might be a bit rough and feature incomplete. However I think just getting this out will give you an idea where things are headed and provide me some feedback as you encounter any friction with the app.

#### What you can do:

* Create a Restore Image Library
* Download the default Apple provided Restore Image (macOS Monterey)
* Create a VM from a Restore Image

* No Pages setup for Help,Privacy Policy, etc...
* No UI to customize VM
