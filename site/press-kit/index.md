## Press Coverage and Releases

### [CompileSwift - macOS Virtual Machines with Bushel, and SwiftData with Leo Dion](https://www.compileswift.com/podcast/s06e02/)
_January 14, 2024_

A conversation between two developers discussing Bushel, an app developed by Leo. Leo explains Bushel is designed as a valuable tool for developers, allowing users to spin up an entire VM of an operating system, trial something, and, if it doesn't work, delete the VM without causing any issue to the primary system.
Bushel also uses the newly released Swift Data for managing database functions. Leo shares his experiences building the app, including challenges initially using ‘User Defaults’ for data storage and navigating the sandboxing system.
