You can easily clone a virtual machine by exporting it from a snapshot. This feature allows you to create a completely separate machine based on a snapshot's state.

#### How to Clone a Machine from a Snapshot

1. Open your virtual machine in Bushel
2. Navigate to the **Snapshots** section
3. Select the snapshot you want to export
4. Click the **Share button** (export icon)
5. Choose where to save the exported machine

The exported machine becomes a standalone VM that you can:
- Use for testing without affecting the original
- Share with team members
- Keep as a backup
- Run simultaneously with the original machine

This is particularly useful when you want to experiment with different configurations or create development environments at specific points in time without risking your primary machine.
