**Yes.** You can install Xcode on VM. That's the purpose of **Bushel** of course. There are [**caveats**](#apple-account) of course but as long as you don't need those features for now, please do install Xcode and do development.

If there's something missing which would help you with development on your VM, [don't hesitate to contact us.](#how-to-post-feature-request-or-feedback)
