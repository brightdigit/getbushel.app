In Bushel, a _Snapshot_ is a point-in-time copy of the current state of a virtual machine (VM). It captures the entire configuration, settings, and data of the VM at that specific moment.

Snapshots serve as a safety net for users, allowing them to create a backup of a VM's state before making changes or updates. This enables easy restoration to a previous state if needed, avoiding potential issues or data loss.

#### Key Features of Snapshots
1. **State Preservation**: Snapshots capture the exact configuration and content of the VM at the time they are taken.
2. **Rollback Capability**: Users can revert a VM back to a specific snapshot, restoring the VM to its state at that particular point in time.
3. **Testing and Debugging**: Snapshots facilitate testing different scenarios or changes within a VM without the risk of permanent alterations.

#### How to Use Snapshots in Bushel

1. **Taking Snapshots**: Within the Bushel interface, initiate the snapshot feature to capture the current state of the VM.
2. **Restoring from Snapshots**: If necessary, revert the VM back to a previously taken snapshot to return to that specific state.
3. **Snapshot Management**: Organize and manage snapshots by naming them descriptively to easily identify specific states of the VM.

Snapshots in Bushel are a vital feature that enables users to capture and restore the state of a virtual machine, providing a safety net for testing and development. By effectively utilizing snapshots, users can experiment and make changes within VMs without the fear of losing critical configurations or data.
