In Bushel, a _Hub_ refers to an online repository or source that provides you with a collection of macOS [restore images](#image) (.ipsw files). Hubs serve as convenient sources for obtaining various versions of macOS to import into your [Library](#library) for setting up virtual machines.

**It's important to note that currently, Bushel supports Apple's latest version of macOS within the available Hubs.** This means you'll have access to the most recent macOS version provided by Apple.

Hubs expand the range of available macOS versions beyond the default offerings within the app. They give you access to a broader selection of macOS restore images, enabling you to create a more diverse range of testing environments.
