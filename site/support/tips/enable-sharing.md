The easiest way to setup sharing across your host machine is to [setup **File Sharing**](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-file-sharing-on-mac-mh17131/mac) on your guest VM. Additionally it may be a good idea to also enable:

-  **Remote Management**
- **Remote Apple Event**
- **Remote Login** (i.e. ssh)

There are a few steps to ensure you can properly ssh into your VM if you wish.
